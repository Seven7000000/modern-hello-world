# User Authentication Feature Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the implementation of user authentication features, including signup, login, password reset, and account management.

## Goals

- Provide secure authentication for users
- Support email/password and social login methods
- Enable password reset functionality
- Allow users to manage their account settings

## User Stories

1. As a new user, I want to create an account so I can access the application.
2. As a returning user, I want to log in to my account.
3. As a user who forgot their password, I want to reset it.
4. As a user, I want to update my profile information.
5. As a user, I want to log out of my account.
6. As a user, I want to delete my account.

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - Collect email, password, and basic profile information
   - Validate email format and password strength
   - Create user account in Auth0
   - Send verification email
   - Redirect to login page with success message

2. **Login**:
   - Provide email/password form
   - Implement social login buttons (Google, Facebook)
   - Handle authentication errors
   - Store JWT token securely
   - Redirect to protected dashboard

3. **Password Reset**:
   - Provide forgot password form
   - Send reset email with secure link
   - Allow password change with token validation
   - Confirm successful reset

### Components

1. **Auth Pages**:
   - `SignupPage.tsx`: User registration form
   - `LoginPage.tsx`: Login form with social options
   - `ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`: Password reset request
   - `ResetPasswordPage.tsx`: New password form

2. **Auth Components**:
   - `AuthForm.tsx`: Reusable form component
   - `SocialLoginButtons.tsx`: Social media login options
   - `PasswordStrengthMeter.tsx`: Password strength indicator

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/register`: Create new user account
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate user
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`: Send password reset email
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password`: Update password with token
- `GET /api/auth/me`: Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/me`: Update user profile
- `DELETE /api/auth/me`: Delete user account

## Testing Plan

- Unit tests for form validation
- Integration tests for auth flows
- E2E tests for critical paths (signup, login, reset)

## Security Considerations

- Implement CSRF protection
- Set secure and httpOnly flags for cookies
- Use proper password hashing
- Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all requests

## Timeline

- Design phase: 1 week
- Implementation: 2 weeks
- Testing: 1 week
- Deployment: 0.5 week

## Dependencies

- Auth0 SDK
- React Hook Form for form validation
- zod for schema validation
