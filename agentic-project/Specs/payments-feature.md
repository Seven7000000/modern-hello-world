# Payment Processing Feature Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the implementation of payment processing features, including payment method management, one-time payments, and subscription handling.

## Goals

- Provide secure payment processing for users
- Support multiple payment methods (credit cards, PayPal)
- Enable subscription management
- Provide payment history and receipts
- Ensure PCI compliance

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to add and manage my payment methods.
2. As a user, I want to make one-time purchases securely.
3. As a user, I want to subscribe to premium services.
4. As a user, I want to view my payment history.
5. As a user, I want to receive receipts for my payments.
6. As a user, I want to cancel or modify my subscriptions.

## Implementation Details

### Payment Flow

1. **Payment Method Management**:
   - Add credit/debit card (with validation)
   - Add PayPal account
   - Set default payment method
   - Remove payment methods
   - Display saved payment methods

2. **One-Time Payment**:
   - Select payment method
   - Review order details
   - Confirm payment
   - Process with Stripe
   - Show confirmation/receipt

3. **Subscription Management**:
   - Select subscription plan
   - Choose payment method
   - Setup recurring billing
   - Manage subscription (pause, cancel, upgrade)
   - Handle failed payments and retries

### Components

1. **Payment Pages**:
   - `PaymentMethodsPage.tsx`: List and manage payment methods
   - `CheckoutPage.tsx`: Complete purchase flow
   - `SubscriptionPage.tsx`: Manage subscriptions
   - `PaymentHistoryPage.tsx`: View payment history

2. **Payment Components**:
   - `PaymentMethodForm.tsx`: Form for adding payment methods
   - `PaymentMethodCard.tsx`: Display payment method details
   - `SubscriptionCard.tsx`: Display subscription details
   - `PaymentSummary.tsx`: Order summary and total
   - `ReceiptModal.tsx`: Payment confirmation/receipt

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/payment/methods`: List saved payment methods
- `POST /api/payment/methods`: Add new payment method
- `DELETE /api/payment/methods/:id`: Remove payment method
- `POST /api/payment/charge`: Process one-time payment
- `GET /api/payment/history`: Get payment history
- `POST /api/subscriptions`: Create new subscription
- `GET /api/subscriptions`: List user subscriptions
- `PUT /api/subscriptions/:id`: Update subscription
- `DELETE /api/subscriptions/:id`: Cancel subscription

## Security Considerations

- No credit card data should be stored on our servers
- Use Stripe Elements for secure card information collection
- Implement strong TLS/SSL for all payment communications
- Validate all payment requests on the server side
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Testing Plan

- Unit tests for payment validation
- Integration tests for payment flows
- E2E tests for critical payment paths
- Security testing for payment endpoints
- Test with Stripe test cards for various scenarios

## Timeline

- Design phase: 1 week
- Implementation: 3 weeks
- Testing: 2 weeks
- Security review: 1 week
- Deployment: 0.5 week

## Dependencies

- Stripe API and SDK
- React Stripe.js
- PayPal SDK (if applicable)
- Database updates for storing payment records
