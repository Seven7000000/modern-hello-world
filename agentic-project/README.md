# Agentic Project

A sample project demonstrating the agentic coding structure for optimal AI collaboration.

## Project Structure

This project uses a specialized folder structure to enhance collaboration with AI coding assistants:

- `AI Docs/`: Knowledge base for APIs, conventions, and integration notes
- `Specs/`: Detailed specifications for features and components
- `.claude/`: Reusable prompts and context priming for AI assistants
- `src/`: Source code for the application

## Getting Started

1. Review documentation in `AI Docs/`
2. Check feature specifications in `Specs/`
3. Use the context priming prompts in `.claude/` when starting a new coding session
