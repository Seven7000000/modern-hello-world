# Development Thinking Log

This document tracks development plans, decisions, key learnings, and thought processes throughout the project.

## Structure

Each development task will be documented with:

1. **Task Definition** - Clear description of what needs to be done
2. **Research & References** - Links to docs, specs, patterns referenced
3. **Plan** - Step-by-step implementation approach
4. **Execution Notes** - Key decisions, challenges, and solutions
5. **Review & Improvements** - What worked, what didn't, what to improve

## Initial Project Setup
*Date: 2023-05-08*

### Task Definition
Set up and configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to provide Claude with external capabilities:
- Python execution
- Shell command execution
- Filesystem operations
- Browser automation

### Research & References
- MCP SDK documentation
- Existing examples of Python and Shell executors
- HTTP transport for MCP servers

### Plan
1. Install the required dependencies
2. Configure and start Python MCP (port 5001)
3. Configure and start Shell MCP (port 5002)
4. Create and configure Filesystem MCP (port 5003)
5. Create and configure Browser MCP (port 5004)
6. Verify all servers are running

### Execution Notes
- Successfully set up Python and Shell MCPs
- Created custom implementations for Filesystem and Browser MCPs
- Added proper HTTP transport for all servers
- Implemented error handling for file operations and browser automation
- All servers now respond to health checks

### Review & Improvements
- All four MCP servers are operational
- Browser MCP uses Puppeteer for automation
- Filesystem MCP supports reading, writing, and directory operations
- Consider adding authentication for all MCPs (only Browser has a token mechanism now)
- Documentation should be expanded for future maintenance
