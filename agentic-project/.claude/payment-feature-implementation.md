# Feature Implementation Plan: Payment Processing

## Overview
Implement secure payment processing functionality to allow users to manage payment methods, make one-time payments, and subscribe to premium services using Stripe as the payment processor.

## Requirements
From the specification in `Specs/payments-feature.md`:
- Support payment method management (add, delete, set default)
- Enable one-time payments with secure checkout
- Implement subscription management
- Provide payment history and receipts
- Ensure PCI compliance and robust security measures

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Research & Preparation
- [x] Review Stripe documentation for React implementation
- [x] Identify necessary dependencies (Stripe SDK, React Stripe.js)
- [x] Document security approach for payment handling

### 2. Component Structure
- [ ] Create new components/files:
  - [ ] `src/pages/PaymentMethodsPage.tsx`: Page to manage payment methods
  - [ ] `src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx`: Checkout flow for payments
  - [ ] `src/pages/SubscriptionPage.tsx`: Subscription management
  - [ ] `src/pages/PaymentHistoryPage.tsx`: Payment history display
  - [ ] `src/components/payment/PaymentMethodForm.tsx`: Form for adding payment methods
  - [ ] `src/components/payment/PaymentMethodCard.tsx`: Display payment method
  - [ ] `src/components/payment/SubscriptionCard.tsx`: Subscription info display
  - [ ] `src/components/payment/PaymentSummary.tsx`: Order summary component
  - [ ] `src/components/payment/ReceiptModal.tsx`: Payment confirmation
- [ ] Update existing components:
  - [ ] Modify `src/components/Navbar.tsx` to include payment-related navigation
  - [ ] Update `src/App.tsx` to add payment-related routes

### 3. API Integration
- [ ] Create Stripe service in `src/services/stripe.service.ts`:
  - [ ] Initialize Stripe with API key
  - [ ] Create Payment Intent functions
  - [ ] Handle subscription creation/modification
- [ ] Define backend API endpoints:
  - [ ] `GET /api/payment/methods`: List payment methods
  - [ ] `POST /api/payment/methods`: Add payment method
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/payment/methods/:id`: Remove payment method
  - [ ] `POST /api/payment/charge`: Process payment
  - [ ] `GET /api/payment/history`: Get payment history
  - [ ] `POST /api/subscriptions`: Create subscription
  - [ ] `GET /api/subscriptions`: List subscriptions
  - [ ] `PUT /api/subscriptions/:id`: Update subscription
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/subscriptions/:id`: Cancel subscription

### 4. State Management
- [ ] Create payment context in `src/context/PaymentContext.tsx`:
  - [ ] Add state for payment methods
  - [ ] Add state for active subscriptions
  - [ ] Add state for payment history
  - [ ] Implement loading and error states
- [ ] Create custom hooks in `src/hooks/usePayment.ts`:
  - [ ] `usePaymentMethods()`: Manage payment methods
  - [ ] `useCheckout()`: Handle checkout flow
  - [ ] `useSubscriptions()`: Manage subscriptions

### 5. UI Implementation
- [ ] Implement PaymentMethodsPage:
  - [ ] Display saved payment methods
  - [ ] Add new payment method form with Stripe Elements
  - [ ] Delete payment method functionality
  - [ ] Set default payment method
- [ ] Implement CheckoutPage:
  - [ ] Order summary component
  - [ ] Payment method selection
  - [ ] Payment processing with loading states
  - [ ] Success/failure handling
- [ ] Implement SubscriptionPage:
  - [ ] Subscription plan selection
  - [ ] Current subscription details
  - [ ] Upgrade/downgrade options
  - [ ] Cancel subscription functionality
- [ ] Implement PaymentHistoryPage:
  - [ ] List of past transactions
  - [ ] Receipt generation
  - [ ] Filtering and sorting options

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for:
  - [ ] Payment validation functions
  - [ ] Payment UI components
  - [ ] Payment hooks and context
- [ ] Write integration tests for:
  - [ ] Complete payment flow
  - [ ] Subscription management flow
- [ ] Implement Stripe test mode for development

### 7. Security Implementation
- [ ] Ensure proper implementation of Stripe Elements for secure card entry
- [ ] Validate all payment requests on the server
- [ ] Implement HTTPS for all payment communications
- [ ] Add rate limiting for payment endpoints
- [ ] Set up monitoring for suspicious activity

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Document payment integration details in codebase
- [ ] Update API documentation for payment endpoints
- [ ] Create usage examples for payment components
- [ ] Document testing procedures with Stripe test cards

## Technical Considerations
- Stripe Elements must be used to ensure PCI compliance
- Payment processing should happen on the server-side, not client-side
- Sensitive payment information should never be stored in our database
- All payment communications must be encrypted

## Potential Challenges
- Handling subscription billing cycles and proration
- Managing payment failures and retry logic
- Ensuring proper error handling for various payment scenarios
- Maintaining PCI compliance throughout the implementation

## Timeline Estimation
- Research & Preparation: 2 days
- Component Structure: 3 days
- API Integration: 4 days
- State Management: 2 days
- UI Implementation: 5 days
- Testing: 3 days
- Security Implementation: 2 days
- Documentation: 1 day

Total Estimated Time: 22 days (approximately 4.5 weeks)
